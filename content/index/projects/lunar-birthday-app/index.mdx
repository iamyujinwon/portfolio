I built a web app using <strong>React</strong> that helps users to convert their solar birthday in the past to the current lunar birthday. <br/>
I published a <strong>Javascript npm</strong> package to calculate lunar date in any target year with customized methods by enhancing an open-source library. <br/>
I integrated with Google Calendar to add the resulting lunar birthday on the userâ€™s Google account. <br/>
Check out my <strong>npm</strong> package (<strong>lunar-birthday-calculator</strong>): https://www.npmjs.com/package/lunar-date-calculator.

I built a web app using <strong>React</strong> to enable users to design business cards and manage them in personal account. <br/>
I am enabled <strong>authentication</strong> using <strong>Firebase Authentication</strong> and integrated with <strong>Firebase Realtime Database</strong> to store user data. <br/>
I integrated with <strong>Cloudinary</strong> to store images uploaded by users and organized the card data based on each user.

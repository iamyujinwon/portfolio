I built a <strong>mobile-first</strong> site using <strong>React</strong> based on responsive design with <strong>TailwindCSS</strong> to promote the product and explain pricing.<br/>
I <strong>prototyped</strong> entire layouts using <strong>Figma</strong> to develop and communicate with team based on <strong>Agile</strong> method.<br/>
I developed <strong>localization</strong> features to add language support for English and Korean.

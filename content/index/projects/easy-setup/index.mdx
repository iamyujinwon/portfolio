I am part of a small core team building a social network app for churches (already launched to my church).
The app is built with Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, TailwindCSS, and StimulusJS.
Current features include: invite-only authentication, authorization levels through permissions, search engine for other church members, editing own profile, and tracking own donations

Hi, I'm Yujin Won. I studied Computer Programming at Seneca College, Toronto and recently graduated.

I love making projects and deploying them.
I believe building a confidence starts from understanding the basic.

I'm always trying to learn and apply the new concepts to my personal projects to improve my skills.

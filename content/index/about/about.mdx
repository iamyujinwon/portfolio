Hi, my beatiful friend. I'm Yujin Won.
I'm a student studying Computer Programming and Analysis at Seneca College in Tronto, Canada.
I'm an energenic and diligent person who always has been challenging something new.
Also, I enjoy spending times thinking creatively like a dreamer.
So, I believe I can do a lot of creative things such as creating useful programs and desigining websites from this field.

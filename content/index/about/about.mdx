Hi, I'm Yujin.

To be honest with you, I did not know the difference between software and hardware until a year ago.
I never imagined that I would be coding as I was growing up.

But now, I love that feeling right when I deploy code (Namu project below), knowing that real people get to use in their daily lives.
And I love the accessibility and infinite possibilities that coding brings.

I know I have a long way to go, but I'm excited to learn!
